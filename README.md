# Simple Shopping Cart

This application, once completed, will be a simple shopping cart application.  You will need to provide the standard database CRUD operations so that the administrator can add, delete, and update items for sale as needed.

The administrator has a password which has been hashed and saved in the database.  You will need to retrieve that password and compare it against what is entered into the form to allow access to admin operations.

The comments marked "FIXME" should be addressed first (by the deadline).  Please think about and/or attempt the TODO items before our next meeting.
